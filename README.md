## hello!

Thanks for checking out my recreation of this front-end coding challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io).

## the challenge

The challenge was to build out this newsletter form and get it looking as close to the given design as possible using whatever tech stack we wanted. A provided template included guides and parameters for what to add into the project.

I decided to just stick to plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for this one.

## what i learned

I think the biggest challenge and new knowledge for me was using javascript to manipulate some css after a certain window/device width. I used media queries in the css but had a hard time with the mobile hero image keep wanting to show up in desktop view.
